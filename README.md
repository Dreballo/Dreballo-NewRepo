# NewRepo

This is my first repo created for The Coding Bootcamp at the University of Central Florida. Within this repo is a static HTML file with sample content.

This code is not deployed so If you would like to review this static HTML, then you can either copy and paste the code into your text editor of choice or download the contents of this repository.

Please send any inquiries to andre.m.seballo@gmail.com
